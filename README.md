<br />Various supervised learning algorithms 
<br />
* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine(SVM)
* Artificial Neural Network(ANNs) 
<br />are used with optimization and performance of these algorithms after optimization is analyzed over testing datasets .
